# Installation for personal use


SCI-VCF can be installed locally in multiple ways!

## Online access

*Important: The online version of SCI-VCF is on shinyapps.io, currently hosted on Amazon’s Web Services (AWS) infrastructure in the US-east-1 region. The infrastructure used is not the HIPAA-compliant stack, and users must take care to upload only anonymized and appropriate data. To work with sensitive data, we recommend a local installation of SCI-VCF.*

Step 1:  Open the [SCI-VCF](https://ibse.shinyapps.io/sci-vcf-online/) website.

*Note: The online version of SCI-VCF comes with upload size limitations. To get the full functionalities of SCI-VCF, use a local/server installation of the tool.*

+ RStudio <a href="https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/" target="_blank">(link)</a>

**Step 3: Launch SCI-VCF**

Open the folder named ```R```. Open ```global.R``` with RStudio and click the ```Run App``` button.

*Note: The first time you launch SCI-VCF by clicking the ```Run App``` button, some dependencies will be downloaded. Kindly wait till then. You need to be connected to the internet and might need to give authorization if required. Once the dependencies are installed, SCI-VCF can be used offline thereafter.*

**Step 6: Open SCI-VCF in a browser**

Copy the IP address at the end of the CLI output from Step 5. Paste it in a browser search tab and load the same. SCI-VCF will be launched.

*Note: For conda-based installation in Windows OS, we recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux. More information is available in the [FAQ](faq.md) section.*

## Docker-based installation

### Prerequisites

+ Docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank">(link)</a>.
+ Web Browser
+ Sudo privileges

**Step 1: Get the SCI-VCF image from Docker Hub and run it**
```
sudo docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 venkatk89/sci-vcf
```

**Step 2: Open SCI-VCF via browser using the address below:**

> http://0.0.0.0:3000/


*Note: The docker command in step 1 is to run the container interactively, which makes SCI-VCF inactive when the terminal is exited. Docker containers can also be run detached from the terminal as a backend job. When the docker image is run this way, SCI-VCF will always stay active at the link mentioned in Step 2. More information is available in the [FAQ](faq.md) section.*
