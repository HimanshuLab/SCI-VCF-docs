## Docker based installation

sudo docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 venkatk89/sci-vcf
```

**Step 2: Open SCI-VCF via browser using the address below:**

*Note: The docker command in step 1 is to run the container interactively, which makes SCI-VCF inactive when the terminal is exited. Docker containers can also be run detached from the terminal as a backend job. When the docker image is run this way, SCI-VCF will always stay active at the link mentioned in Step 2. More information is available in the [FAQ](faq.md) section.*
