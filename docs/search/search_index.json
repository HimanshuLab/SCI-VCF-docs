Online access Step 1: Open the SCI-VCF website. Note: Online version of SCI-VCF comes with upload size limitations. To get the full functionalities of SCI-VCF, use a local/server installation of the tool. RStudio based installation Prerequisites R (version > 4.2) (link) RStudio (link) Procedure Step 1: Get the SCI-VCF repository from GitHub. You can download the zipped version of the repo at this link Step 2: Extract the files in your computer. This will create a foler in you computer called SCI-VCF-main. Open that folder. Step 3: Launch SCI-VCF Open the folder named R . Open global.R with RStudio and click the Run App button. Note: The first time you launch SCI-VCF by clicking the Run App button, some dependencies will be downloaded. Kindly wait till then. You need to be connected to the internet and might need to give authorization if required. Once the dependencies are installed, SCI-VCF can be used offline thereafter. Conda based installation Prerequisites Conda (link) Command Line Interface Procedure Step 1: Get the SCI-VCF repository from GitHub git clone https://github.com/venkatk89/SCI-VCF Step 2: Open the SCI-VCF directory cd SCI-VCF Step 3: Create the conda environment with all required dependencies conda env create -f conda/SCI-VCF_conda_env.yaml Step 4: Activate the conda environment created conda activate SCI-VCF Step 5: Open global.R in RStudio rstudio global.R Step 5: Launch SCI-VCF by clicking the Run App button. Note: For conda-based installation in Windoas OS, we recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux. More information is available in the FAQ section. Docker based installation Prerequisites Docker (link) . Command Line Interface Step 1: Get the SCI-VCF image from Docker Hub and run it sudo docker run -d --rm -p 3000:3000 venkatk89/sci-vcf Step 2: Open SCI-VCF via browser using the address below: http://0.0.0.0:3000/","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#installation","text":"SCI-VCF can be installed in multiple ways!","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#online-access","text":"Step 1: Open the SCI-VCF website.
